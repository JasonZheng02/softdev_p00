    Never be afraid to ask questions about something you don't, even if they are really small.
    Never be afraid to suggest and ask for better ways to do something.
    Make meaningful comments on your code 
    Review each other's code after every commit to make sure you understand its use, and to make sure its free of errors 
    Stick to the basics. Don't get caught up in libraries or use things that you don't fully understand
